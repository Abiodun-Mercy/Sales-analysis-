# Sales-analysis-
This was the first project done as an intern with meriSKILL.

We were asked to carry out a sales analysis on a dataset that was provided by the company. 
I took enough time to understand the data first and then data cleaning was done using the power query editor. I ensured duplicates were removed to avoid errors in the final results.
Analysis and visualizations were done with Microsoft PowerBi and Excel. I was able to see trends of products over the years(i.e the top selling products, the total revenue generated over the period, the products in high demand and the country with the highest revenue).
I was able to draw insights and recommendations from raw data.
